since connectdb method is asynchronous, it returns promise
    use .then and .catch to handle this in src/index.js

write code for app.listen in connectdb in src/index.js

npm i cokie-parser cors

app.use -> is generally used for middlewares

write middlewares in app.js
    - cors middleware -> to only allow requests from specific origin, * means allow all
    - express.json -> means we are accepting json, setting limit.
    - express.urlencoded -> to let express understand data of url encoded format, extended let us give nested object (not necessarily needed), set limit
    - express.static -> allows you to serve static files from a directory
    - cookieParser -> to work on cookies

(err, req, res, next)

next is used for middlewares, its a flag, when a middleware completes its work next is used

utils files are just helper/wraper files, repeated codes are written here

nodejs has prebuilt error class, we are over-writing the class here
