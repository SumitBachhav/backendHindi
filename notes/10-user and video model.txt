we should use index sparely

npm i mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2
-> used to write aggregation querries

add it as a plugin in videoSchema with mongoose hook

npm i bcrypt
-> it helps you to hash your password

npm i jsonwebtoken
-> make tokens

using mongoose pre hook we can write operation to be performed before data saves
in this hook context is important, so this keyword is needed
it takes time, async keywordis needed

a middleware will have next as a parameter

jwt is bearer token, means anyone with token will have access to data

write this in env file
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = someLongRandomStringHaving_-AlphabetNumbersCapitalAndSmall
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY = 1d
    REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET = someLongRandomStringHaving_-AlphabetNumbersCapitalAndSmall
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY = 10d

    access token will not be stored in database
    refresh token will be stored in database
